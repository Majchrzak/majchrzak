I'm a software engineer with nine years of professional experience in software development. Most recently, I'm focusing on web development, especially in the finance field. I worked for many diverse software companies from early-stage startups to large companies like BNP Paribas or Pfizer. My leading programming language is C#, but constantly expanding my knowledge to TypeScript. I'm also an active open source contributor focusing to deliver high-quality software to the community.
