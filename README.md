### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with eight years of professional experience. Most recently, I'm focusing on web development especially in the finance field. I worked for many diverse software companies from early-stage startups to BNP Paribas S.A.. My leading programming language is C#, but constantly expanding my knowledge to TypeScript. I'm also active open source contributor focusing to deliver high-quality software to the community.
